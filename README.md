This Managed Components uses the [Embeds API](https://managedcomponents.dev/specs/embed-and-widgets/embeds) to render Instagram posts on a web page, with its embed `instagram-post`. This Embed accepts the folowing parameters:

#### Post URL _required_

Specify the post you wish to render using the `post-url` parameter. The value should hold the full URL, excluding any query parameters.

#### Captions _optional_

Use the `captions` parameter to determine whether to include post captions. If captions parameter is set to true, the MC will render the post including its captions. Otherwise, it will render the post without captions.

---
**Examples:**
1. To place an embed on a page using WebCM, use a placeholder div element with the following attributes:

  ```html
  <div
    data-component-embed="instagram-instagram-post"
    data-post-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Sk6d2MTjI/"
    data-captions="true"
  ></div>
  ```
2.  To place an embed on a page using Cloudflare Zaraz, use a placeholder `instagram-post` HTML element with the following attributes:

  ```html
  <instagram-post
    post-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Sk6d2MTjI/"
    captions="true"
  ></instagram-post>
  ```
### Support
